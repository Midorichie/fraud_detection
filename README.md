# AI-Powered Fraud Detection System for Blockchain Gaming

This project implements a comprehensive fraud detection system for blockchain-based games, leveraging machine learning techniques and the transparency of the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

The AI-Powered Fraud Detection System consists of the following key components:

1. **Game Engine Plugins (Rust)**: Rust-based plugins that capture player behavior data and transaction history from Stacks-based blockchain games, and securely transmit the data to the Fraud Detection Service.

2. **Fraud Detection Service (Python)**: A centralized service that ingests the player data, trains machine learning models to detect various types of fraud (bot detection, multi-accounting, transaction fraud), and provides an API for games to query the fraud detection models.

3. **Fraud Reporting Smart Contract (Clarity)**: A Clarity smart contract that allows game developers to submit fraud reports, with a community-based review process where Stacks blockchain users can vote on the validity of the reports.

4. **Fraud Analytics Dashboard**: A web-based dashboard built with React and the shadcn/ui component library, which integrates with the Fraud Detection Service and Fraud Reporting Smart Contract to provide game developers with fraud detection insights, metrics, and management capabilities.

The system leverages advanced machine learning techniques and the transparency of the Stacks blockchain to detect and mitigate various types of fraud, ensuring a fair and secure gaming experience for players.

## Key Features

- **Bot Detection**: Identifies automated, bot-like behavior using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
- **Multi-Accounting**: Detects suspicious account linkages based on player behavior patterns and network characteristics using a deep learning model.
- **Transaction Fraud**: Identifies fraudulent payment activities using an XGBoost-based transaction-level fraud detection model.
- **Fraud Reporting and Community Review**: Allows game developers to submit fraud reports, which are then reviewed and validated by the Stacks blockchain community.
- **Fraud Analytics Dashboard**: Provides game developers with a comprehensive interface to view fraud detection metrics, model performance, risk scores, and manage fraud reports.
- **Stacks Blockchain Integration**: Leverages the Stacks blockchain for secure data transmission, fraud report storage, and community-based review processes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AI-Powered Fraud Detection System for Blockchain Gaming, please follow these steps:

1. **Deploy the Fraud Detection Service**: Set up the Python-based Fraud Detection Service, including the machine learning models and RESTful API.
2. **Integrate the Game Engine Plugins**: Integrate the Rust-based game engine plugins into your Stacks-based blockchain games to capture player data and send it to the Fraud Detection Service.
3. **Deploy the Fraud Reporting Smart Contract**: Deploy the Clarity-based Fraud Reporting Smart Contract on the Stacks blockchain.
4. **Set up the Fraud Analytics Dashboard**: Configure and deploy the web-based Fraud Analytics Dashboard to provide game developers with a centralized interface for fraud detection and management.
5. **Configure and Customize**: Customize the fraud detection models, thresholds, and other system parameters to fit the needs of your blockchain gaming ecosystem.

Detailed deployment and integration instructions can be found in the project's documentation.
